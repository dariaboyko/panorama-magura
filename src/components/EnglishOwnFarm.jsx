      <p className="text">
        We have cute our goats and chickens, so we always have fresh milk and
        eggs. We make our own cheeses and dairy products from goats' milk. Also
        we make soaps, and in the summer we collect herbs for real Carpathian
        tea. All products are made with our own hands and from natural products.
        You can go on a walk with our goats in the mountains. If you have any
        animals you can come with them.
